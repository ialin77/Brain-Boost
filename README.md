# BrainBoost

BrainBoost is a learning website and could be identified as a forum due to the possibility of debating and expressing your point of view or adding a completion of a post on a topic in the comments.
The main topics of the BrainBoost are history, geography, IT, tech, sports, or other topics from which you can learn something.

For the website, I used the Python language for all functionalities. The entire application was written in PyCharm and for the realization of the project, I used the Djnago web framework for the development of the website and the Django template for the front-end.


The project is structured in one application in the Django framework where we can find all the main functionalities such as registering, logging, logout, and editing the profile of the user. Also the functionality of searching, creating, editing, and deleting a post owned by you. The last main functionality is to add a comment on an existing post.

Database
----------
For the database of this project, I used DB SQLite3 for storing all my data of the store.

Front end
-----------
For the front end of the website, I used Django templates where I stored the HTML, Django template tags, and language.

*** The templates used in this project weren't created by me,  I just modified and adapted them for my vision of the store design. ***
